<h3>About</h3>
This is a P.O.C of Weemo Video call integration in eXo iOS application.
<h3>How it works</h3>
<ul>
<li>
    After authenticating to eXo Platform, user is connected to Weemo cloud using his Platform username
</li>
<li>
To use video call, go to Home menu and select Call.
</li>
<li>To call a user, select him in people list or enter manually his eXo Platform username in Dial tab.
</li>
<li>
The people list is currently hard-coded. We are waiting for <a href="https://jira.exoplatform.org/browse/SOC-3848">SOC-3848</a> to display user's connections.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Known issues</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        To receive call, eXo mobile app must be active. TODO: handle incoming call when the app is in background mode.
    </li>
<li>
Weemo SDK does not work well if the connection is bad. It often disconnects automatically and we have no way to catch this event. When you can't call a user and there is no response from the app, please try to log out and login again.
</li>
<li>
Probably because of connection quality, sometime the call is made but there is only voice, the video view is blank.
</li>
<li>
Orientation handling in iPad
