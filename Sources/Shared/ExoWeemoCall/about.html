<h3>About</h3>
This is a P.O.C of Weemo Video call integration in eXo iOS application. Weemo SDK needs at least iPhone 4s and iOS 5.1.
<h3>How it works</h3>
<ul>
<li>
    After authenticating to intranet, user is connected to Weemo cloud using his intranet account</li>
<li>
To use video call, go to Home menu and select Call.
</li>
<li>To call a user, select him in people list or enter manually his intranet account in Dial tab.
</li>
<li>
The people list is currently hard-coded. We are waiting for <a href="https://jira.exoplatform.org/browse/SOC-3848">SOC-3848</a> to display user's connections.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tips</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>You can check the connection status by checking the app log using free app <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/consolekit/id648875678?mt=8">Consolekit</a> from App store </li>
