<h3>About</h3>
This is a P.O.C of Weemo Video call integration in eXo iOS application. Weemo SDK needs at least iPhone 4s and iOS 5.1.
<h3>How it works</h3>
<ul>
<li>
    After authenticating intranet, user is connected to Weemo cloud using his intranet account</li>
<li>
To use video call, go to Home menu and select Call.
</li>
<li>To call a user, select him in people list or enter manually his intranet account in Dial tab.
</li>
<li>
The people list is currently hard-coded. We are waiting for <a href="https://jira.exoplatform.org/browse/SOC-3848">SOC-3848</a> to display user's connections.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Known issues</h3>
<ul>
    
<li>
Weemo SDK does not work well if the connection is bad. It often disconnects automatically and we have no way to catch this event. When you can't call a user and there is no response from the app, please try to log out/kill the app and login again. (You can check the connection status by looking at the app log by using <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/consolekit/id648875678?mt=8">Consolekit</a> from App store )</li>
<li>
Probably because of connection quality, sometime the call is made but there is only voice, the video view is blank.
</li>
<li>
    To receive call, eXo mobile app must be active. TODO: handle incoming call when the app is in background mode.
</li>
</ul>
