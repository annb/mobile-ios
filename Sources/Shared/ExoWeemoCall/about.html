<h3>About</h3>
This is a P.O.C of Weemo Video call integration in eXo iOS application. Weemo SDK needs at least iPhone 4s and iOS 5.1.

<h3>How it works</h3>
<ul>
<li>
You are connected to Weemo cloud using your intranet account some seconds after logging in to intranet.
</li>
<li>
    Select Call from Home Menu. Select a contact in Contacts Tab or enter a username in Dial Tab to start a call.
</li>
<li>
The contact list is currently hard-coded. We are waiting for <a href="https://jira.exoplatform.org/browse/SOC-3848">SOC-3848</a> to display user's connections.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>For more details about connection status, check application log by using free <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/consolekit/id648875678?mt=8">Consolekit</a> from App store
</li>
    
</ul>
<h3>Known issues</h3>
<ul>
    
<li>
With a slow network, Weemo SDK often disconnects automatically without any notification (yet). When you can't call a user and there is no response, please try to log out and login again. </li>
<li>
Probably because of connection quality, sometime the call is made but there is only voice and the video view is blank.
</li>
<li>
    To receive call, eXo mobile app must be active. TODO: handle incoming call when the app is in background mode.
</li>
</ul>
